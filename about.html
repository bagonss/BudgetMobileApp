      <h2>Technical Notes</h2>
      <p>For the past couple of years, majority of my focus has gone towards building projects that brings ideas to lifethrough clean and engaging UIs. I have had the most success creating mobile projects using Flutter to design user-friendly and smooth layouts to give a natural feel. I still like to touch backend when needed, but what really gets me excited is turning a simple idea into a polished, interactive app experience. </p>

      <h2>A Brief History</h2>
      <p>I recently graduated from Kennesaw State University with a bachelor’s in Computer Science, after starting out at Georgia Military College where I earned my associate’s. Outside of school and coding, I’ve always been big into music, sports, and video games and somehow those always find their way back into my programming projects. Whether it’s building an app, tinkering with new ideas, or just trying to bring something I enjoy into code, I like finding that overlap between my hobbies and tech. </p>
